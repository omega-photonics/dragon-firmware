Welcome to Xilinx CORE Generator.
Help system initialized.
The IP Catalog has been reloaded.

WARNING:sim:991 - The project IP instance 'endpoint_blk_plus_v1_14' for IP
   'Endpoint Block Plus for PCI Express v1.14' was generated with a different
   version of the IP than is currently in the IP Catalog. It was originally
   generated using IP with the packaged timestamp '2011-02-03+22:14'; the IP in
   the current catalog has a different packaged timestamp '2012-07-21+06:17'.
   This mismatch is due to changes made to the IP in the user repositories. It
   may affect some functionality of the IP, if there are differences between
   these two versions of the IP.
WARNING:sim:991 - The project IP instance 'fifo_buffer_addresses' for IP 'Fifo
   Generator v8.1' was generated with a different version of the IP than is
   currently in the IP Catalog. It was originally generated using IP with the
   packaged timestamp '2011-02-03+22:23'; the IP in the current catalog has a
   different packaged timestamp '2012-07-21+06:07'. This mismatch is due to
   changes made to the IP in the user repositories. It may affect some
   functionality of the IP, if there are differences between these two versions
   of the IP.
WARNING:sim:991 - The project IP instance 'fifo_tlp_data' for IP 'Fifo Generator
   v8.1' was generated with a different version of the IP than is currently in

   timestamp '2011-02-03+22:23'; the IP in the current catalog has a different
   packaged timestamp '2012-07-21+06:07'. This mismatch is due to changes made
   to the IP in the user repositories. It may affect some functionality of the
   IP, if there are differences between these two versions of the IP.
